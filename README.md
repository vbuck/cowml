# CowML
Experience HTML5 through the power of the cow.

This project is a silly HTML parser that enables you to
define complex element structures and write them via
shorter aliases.

# Concept
You can shorten this:

```html
<div class="animal type-cow variant-brown float-right">I'm a cow</div>
```

Into this:

```html
<cow>I'm a cow</cow>
```

With the latter translated to the former at run-time.

See the `tests` folder for more examples of usage.
